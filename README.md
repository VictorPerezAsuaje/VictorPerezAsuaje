# 👋 Hi! 

I’m Victor Pérez Asuaje, nice to meet you 😄

## 👀 About me

I'm a full-stack web developer who uses .NET (both framework and core) on a daily basis. I enjoy both front-end and back-end development, but I've been mostly interested in software architecture in terms of system design. Nevertheless, lately, I've found myself delving into more in-depth knowledge in SQL and database management, system administration, and cybersecurity; so who knows where this path will lead to!

When I'm not coding, I try to write articles (sadly, almost none lately), do some exercise (I've been picking up calisthenics once again) 🏃‍♂️ or just chill by playing the guitar or piano 🎵.

## 🌱 What I'm up to right now

I've been quite invested into determining which will be my "next step". However, in the meantime, I've been learning WebComponents, Cybersecurity (which seems to be a broader area than I expected it to be) and Angular 17 + NET 8 API.
