# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

Iâ€™m Victor PÃ©rez Asuaje, nice to meet you ðŸ˜„

## ðŸ‘€ About me

Lately I've been mostly working on front-end development and design, but honestly I enjoy both front and back end. In fact, I've worked on projects with Django and I've done some projects using Python for Data Science with Jupyter Notebook. 

Also, I recently "discovered" the UX area, Android Development and ASP.NET Core MVC, so I'm pretty much hooked on those three hehe

When I'm not coding I try to design, write articles, create tutorials/animations for
youtube, or just chill playing guitar or piano ðŸŽµ.


## ðŸŒ± What I'm up to right now

Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge on CSS, SASS and Javascript. I'm also studying for the Advanced Tecnician Certificate on Multiplatform Application Development. 

Meanwhile I try to post what I'm learning on my Social Media, so feel free to follow me on instagram @todayilearned_eu.
