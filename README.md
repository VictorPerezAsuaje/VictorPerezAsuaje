# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

Iâ€™m Victor PÃ©rez Asuaje, nice to meet you ðŸ˜„

## ðŸ‘€ About me

I'm a full stack web developer that uses .NET (both framework and core) on a daily basis. I enjoy both front and back end, but lately I've been mostly interested in software arquitecture in terms of system design, which has led me to discover how much I didn't know that I didn't know despite having 2 years of experience.

When I'm not coding I try to design, write articles, create tutorials for youtube, or just chill playing guitar or piano ðŸŽµ.


## ðŸŒ± What I'm up to right now

I've been quite invested into determining which will be my "next step". However, in the meantime, I've been learning WebComponents, Cybersecurity (which seems to be a broader area than I expected it to be) and Angular 17 + NET 8 API.
