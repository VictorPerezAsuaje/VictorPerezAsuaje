# 👋 Hi! 

I’m Victor Pérez Asuaje, nice to meet you 😄

## 👀 About me

I'm a full stack web developer that uses .NET (both framework and core) on a daily basis. I enjoy both front and back end, but lately I've been mostly interested in software arquitecture in terms of system design, which has led me to discover how much I didn't know that I didn't know despite having 2 years of experience.

When I'm not coding I try to design, write articles, create tutorials for youtube, or just chill playing guitar or piano 🎵.


## 🌱 What I'm up to right now

Recently I have published my first nuget package. I know, "big deal 🙄", right? But it was a first for me 😁. It is called "AdvancedRepositories" and it's on a pre-release state, but you can check it out and use it freely as it's open source:

NuGET: https://www.nuget.org/packages/AdvancedRepositories/0.2.1-pre
GitHub: https://github.com/VictorPerezAsuaje/AdvancedRepositories
